* add manual creation of entry in "schools" table to some checklist somewhere
* modify update-all-students to process all schools (should not be authenticated)



each school will have two auto-generated accounts:
1. trvs
2. trvs-admin


for admin access, put an iframe in a new E-Attendance tab, post login credentials
using an ajax form to the iframe:

in DST, add a setting for the password for the signin sheet (non-admin) account

password for each school's admin account will be the same, and will be stored
in an environment variable for DST to read
